    "# GHZ State Preparation with Parallelism\n",
    "In this example, we will implement a *Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger* (GHZ) state preparation circuit with $N = 2^n$ qubits. Our goal is to learn how to deploy QASM files with Bloqade that can be interpreted by neutral-atom quantum computers while making use of specific features of this technology. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will present the standard linear-depth construction of a GHZ state preparation circuit in Bloqade. Following that, we will show a log-depth construction that achieves the same result and build it in Bloqade. This log-depth construction is very convenient for us, as Bloqade (and QuEra's neutral atom hardware!) support *parallel* gates, allowing for the application of the same gate across multiple qubits simultaneously. We thus take this one step further and, combining the circuit above with the arbitrary connectivity enabled by atom *shuttling*, we showcase how to achieve log-depth not only the circuit logic but also in its *execution*. We will tie it all together with an excursion on how to develop optimized compiler passes with `Bloqade` and `Kirin` to automate workflow.\n",

The first qubit is just brought into a $|+ \\rangle$ state, which would be our 1-qubit GHZ state. The next CNOT brings us to the 2-qubit GHZ state  $\\sim |00 \\rangle+|11 \\rangle$ (also known as a Bell state). Now notice that the qubits in each register are equivalent. This means that instead of using $q_0$ as the control for the next layer, we could just as well use $q_1$. This symmetry propagates throughout and we can choose any qubit for control as long as it has previously been at target. This cascading of controls is what see in the QASM representation above."

    "Now we can fix the execution parallelization. By nature, neutral-atom quantum computers can execute certain native gates in parallel in a single instruction/ execution cycle. The concept is very similar to the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) in classical computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "On our hardware, there are two important factors to be considered:\n",
    "1. the native gate set allows for arbitrary (parallel) single-qubit rotations and (parallel) 2-qubit CZ gates.\n",
    "2. Our atom shuttling architecture allows arbitrary qubit connectivity. This means that our parallel instruction is not limited to fixed connectivity (for example nearest neighbor connectivity).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say \"in parallel\" we mean that the gates can be deployed simultaneously over many qubits, but also that the gates to be deployed have to be _exactly_ the same. In practice, how many gates can really be deployed in parallel, and how efficient atom transport or laser targeting is for that realization, depends on the given hardware capabilities. We can ignore that for the time being, for pedagogical purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above in mind, we can rewrite the `layer` subroutine above to now use the `qasm2.parallel` dialect in Bloqade. But we also have to choose gates within our native hardware-deployable set. CNOT gates can be decomposed into CZ gates with $R_y(-\\pi/2)$ and $R_y(\\pi/2)$ single-qubit gates flanking the target qubits. $R_y(\\theta)$ rotations can be represented natively for us in terms of $U3(\\theta,\\phi,\\lambda)$ gates for which we follow standard convention such as [this](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/0.41/qiskit.circuit.library.U3Gate). We thus have $R_y(\\theta) \\equiv U3(\\theta,0,0)$. The Hadamard can also be represented via such rotations, now as $H \\equiv U3(\\pi/2,0,\\pi)$. This decomposition brings us to our native gate set.\n",

The code above already built - by hand - instructions that were deployable in parallel via the declaration of `parallel.u` and `parallel.cz` with multiple targets. These instructions come up as delimiters `{}`, but to ensure that output instructions from Bloqade won't conflict with other QASM, we omit those by default.

Let's learn to use these features using our GHZ state preparation example.\n",

This extended QASM is considered a dialect of Bloqade, a sub-language (eDSL). Now we will create our dialect group to help automate the parallelization and compilation process. For that, we use tools from our Kirin compiler toolchain and create a new compiler! Without further ado, the code below allows for the creation of what we need."
