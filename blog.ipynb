    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We are proud to share that we won QuEra Computing’s challenge at the ETH Zurich Quantum Hackathon. The event spanned three intense and rewarding days. After the opening keynote, we were introduced to the five available challenges and had the opportunity to briefly visit ETH Zurich’s cutting-edge research facilities. Among the proposed topics, we were particularly drawn to QuEra’s challenge, which focused on optimizing quantum circuits for their neutral-atom quantum computing hardware, a problem that resonated strongly with our background in Computer Engineering and High Performance Computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the second day, we met Pedro and John from the QuEra Computing team, who presented the technical details of the task and provided valuable guidance throughout the competition. Once the challenge was fully explained, the 25-hour countdown began—and so did our focused effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this was our first hackathon experience, we found it to be deeply educational, technically demanding, and ultimately very fulfilling. What set our team apart was our distinctive approach, different from that of most other participants, shaped by our perspective as computer engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we share our experience and reflect on the process that led us to our final solution.\n"

    "# Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "During the initial phase of the challenge, we dedicated our time to understand the provided resources: the detailed challenge description document, associated academic papers, and tutorial notebooks showcasing QuEra’s software tools. This foundational phase was crucial for building a strong conceptual framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In subsequent discussions with John and Pedro, we realized there was an opportunity to delve deeper into their software infrastructure. Using built-in debugging features, we explored the internal architecture of their compiler, which allowed us to gain insights and  design our own optimization passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we entered the second half of the challenge, we  split our efforts into two parallel tasks to maximize efficiency during the intensive overnight session:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One subgroup focused on developing custom optimization passes.\n",
    "- The other subgroup worked on manually analyzing and parallelizing circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To objectively evaluate our results, we established a set of clear metrics, prioritized as follows:\n",
    "1. Fidelity – ensuring that the optimized circuits maintained equivalence to the originals.\n",
    "2. Total CZ gate count – more relevant than U gates due to the higher cost of CZ gates.\n",
    "3. Total U gate count – aiming to minimize overall gate usage.\n",
    "4. Parallel CZ gate count.\n",
    "5. Parallel U gate count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal optimization corresponds to fidelity close to 1 and minimized gate counts, with a high degree of parallelization.\n"

    "## Passes\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, our computer science background played a crucial role in shaping our approach to this challenge, both positively and negatively. Unlike other teams, we dedicated nearly half of the hackathon to thoroughly understanding and exploring the libraries provided. While this initially slowed us down, it ultimately became one of the key reasons for our success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than focusing solely on manual optimization, we invested significant effort into automating the process. Our goal was not only to solve the specific challenge, but also to develop a scalable method, one that could be generalized and applied to a broader class of quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mindset led us to design and implement a set of custom optimization passes, extending those already available in the Bloqade library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pass was specifically crafted to address bottlenecks identified during initial profiling of the circuits. \n",
    "These passes included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Redundant Gate Elimination: removes 2pi gates that are introduced during the internal Rewrite\n",
    "- U Gate Merge Pass: combines adjacent single-qubit gates to reduce overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used native passes from the Bloqade library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rydberg Gate Set Rewrite: this pass translates all gates in the given circuits into CZ and U gates (the hardware gate set)\n",
    "- UOpToParallel: this pass identifies and rewrites gates that can be parallelized\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code cells allow you to try these passes and freely experiment."

These gates have no effect on the quantum state and can therefore be safely removed. The next objective is to reorder the remaining CNOT gates in a way that both preserves the correctness of the circuit and maximizes parallelism. This is crucial, as the target architecture allows for the simultaneous execution of multiple gates in a single time step, provided that no two gates act on the same qubit. Doing this the result obtained was this one:"

    "By examining the updated circuit diagram, we can observe that the entire sequence can now be executed in just four steps. To further assist the optimizer in producing a more efficient layout, we inserted barriers between groups of non-overlapping CNOT gates. These barriers explicitly define sets of operations that can be safely parallelized, improving both the structure and the readability of the circuit.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Barrier insertion and queue refresh**  \n",
    "   After filling a layer, insert a barrier to delineate it. Reinsert into the queue any qubits that still have pending CNOTs (with their updated target counts).\n",

Such approaches may uncover non-obvious parallelism patterns but require substantial training examples, a simulation environment for reward feedback, and careful integration of hard hardware constraints.\n"
