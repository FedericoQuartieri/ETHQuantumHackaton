    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We are proud to share that we won QuEra Computing’s challenge at the ETH Zurich Quantum Hackathon. The event spanned three intense and rewarding days. After the opening keynote, we were introduced to the five available challenges and had the opportunity to briefly visit ETH Zurich’s cutting-edge research facilities. Among the proposed topics, we were particularly drawn to QuEra’s challenge, which focused on optimizing quantum circuits for their neutral-atom quantum computing hardware, a problem that resonated strongly with our background in Computer Engineering and High Performance Computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the second day, we met Pedro and John from the QuEra Computing team, who presented the technical details of the task and provided valuable guidance throughout the competition. Once the challenge was fully explained, the 25-hour countdown began—and so did our focused effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this was our first hackathon experience, we found it to be deeply educational, technically demanding, and ultimately very fulfilling. What set our team apart was our distinctive approach, different from that of most other participants, shaped by our perspective as computer engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we share our experience and reflect on the process that led us to our final solution.\n"

    "# Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "During the initial phase of the challenge, we dedicated our time to understand the provided resources: the detailed challenge description document, associated academic papers, and tutorial notebooks showcasing QuEra’s software tools. This foundational phase was crucial for building a strong conceptual framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In subsequent discussions with John and Pedro, we realized there was an opportunity to delve deeper into their software infrastructure. Using built-in debugging features, we explored the internal architecture of their compiler, which allowed us to gain insights and  design our own optimization passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we entered the second half of the challenge, we  split our efforts into two parallel tasks to maximize efficiency during the intensive overnight session:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One subgroup focused on developing custom optimization passes.\n",
    "- The other subgroup worked on manually analyzing and parallelizing circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To objectively evaluate our results, we established a set of clear metrics, prioritized as follows:\n",
    "1. Fidelity – ensuring that the optimized circuits maintained equivalence to the originals.\n",
    "2. Parallel CZ gate count – more relevant than U gates due to the higher cost of CZ gates.\n",
    "3. Parallel U gate count.\n",
    "4. Sequential CZ gate count.\n",
    "5. Sequential U gate count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal optimization corresponds to fidelity close to 1 and minimized gate counts, with a high degree of parallelization.\n"

   "source": [
    "## Passes\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, our computer science background played a crucial role in shaping our approach to this challenge, both positively and negatively. Unlike other teams, we dedicated nearly half of the hackathon to thoroughly understanding and exploring the libraries provided. While this initially slowed us down, it ultimately became one of the key reasons for our success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than focusing solely on manual optimization, we invested significant effort into automating the process. Our goal was not only to solve the specific challenge, but also to develop a scalable method, one that could be generalized and applied to a broader class of quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mindset led us to design and implement a set of custom optimization passes, extending those already available in the Bloqade library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pass was specifically crafted to address bottlenecks identified during initial profiling of the circuits. \n",
    "These passes included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Redundant Gate Elimination: removes 2pi gates that are introduced during the internal Rewrite\n",
    "- U Gate Merge Pass: combines adjacent single-qubit gates to reduce overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used native passes from the Bloqade library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rydberg Gate Set Rewrite: this pass translates all gates in the given circuits into CZ and U gates (the hardware gate set)\n",
    "- UOpToParallel: this pass identifies and rewrites gates that can be parallelized\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code cells allow you to try these passes and freely experiment."

    "\n",
    "For instance, in the optimized version of the circuit, the bottleneck is represented by qubit 11, which is the target of three CNOT gates.
